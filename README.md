# Iris-Flower-Classification

Iris Flower Classification:-
This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their sepal and petal dimensions. It utilizes machine learning techniques to build a predictive model from the famous Iris dataset.
The Iris Flower Classification project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms for classification tasks. By training on the Iris dataset, the model can predict the species of iris flowers accurately based on their features.
We have used KNN Algorithm for classification.
